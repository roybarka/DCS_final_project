Charlie Reade, a 17-year-old boy, lives in Sentry's Rest, Illinois, with his widowed father, George.
When Charlie was seven years old, his mother was struck and killed by a van; the resulting grief led 
his father to alcoholism, from which he eventually recovered with the help of a friend and co-worker,
though Charlie remains fearful that he will someday resume drinking.
