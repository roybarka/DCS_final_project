Charlie Reade, a 17-year-old boy, lives in Sentry's Rest, Illinois, with his widowed father, George.
When Charlie was seven years old, his mother was struck and killed by a van; the resulting grief led 
his father to alcoholism, from which he eventually recovered with the help of a friend and co-worker,
though Charlie remains fearful that he will someday resume drinking.

One day in April 2013, Charlie discovers his elderly neighbor, Mr. Howard Bowditch, injured in his yard.
Feeling indebted to a higher power for his father's recovery, Charlie agrees to care for Mr. Bowditch's 
elderly German Shepherd, Radar, while he stays in the hospital. He also looks after Mr. Bowditch himself 
when he returns home. During that period, Mr. Bowditch shares with Charlie both his .45 caliber handgun 
and a surprising stash of gold pellets that he uses to pay his hospital bills.
